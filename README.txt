1.arp :
ARP is a network layer protocol which is used to find the physical address from
 the IP address.
The two terms are mainly associated with the ARP Protocol:
ARP request: When a sender wants to know the physical address of the
device, it broadcasts the ARP request to the network.
ARP reply: Every device attached to the network will accept the ARP request
and process the request, but only recipient recognize the IP address and sends
back its physical address in the form of ARP reply.
arp –a :- Shows respective entries in arp table
arp –d :-Flushes arp entries
2. ipconfig:
This diagnostic command displays all current TCP/IP network
configuration values. This command is useful on computers running
DHCP because it enables users to determine which TCP/IP configuration
values have been configured by DHCP. If you enter only ipconfig without
parameters, the response is a display of all of the current TCP/IP
configuration values, including IP address, subnet mask, and default
gateway.
3. ping: This diagnostic command verifies connections to one or
more remote computers.
4. tracert:
This diagnostic utility determines the route taken to a destination by
sending Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo packets with
varying time-to-live (TTL) values to the destination.
